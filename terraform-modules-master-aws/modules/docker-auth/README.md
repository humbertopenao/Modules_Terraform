# Docker Authentication

This module serves as a post-bootstrap addon for the Core Module. It allows you to configure Nomad
clients to authenticate with private Docker registries.

This is intended to be used alongside the [core](../core).

## Pre-requisites

You must have Terraformed the [core](../core) module first. In addition, you must have at least
initialised and unsealed the Vault servers.

You **must** also provision this with the [aws-auth](../aws-auth) module. You **must** give the
`nomad_client` token role in `aws-auth` the `docker_auth` policy.

You can use both modules in the same Terraform module to provision to satisfy the requirements.
For example:

```hcl

module "docker_auth" {
    source = "..."

    # ...
}

module "aws_auth" {
    source = "..."

    # ...

    # Attach policy to allow creation of tokens for Nomad servers
    nomad_client_policies = ["...", "${module.docker_auth.policy_name}"]
}

```

## Vault Provider

Refer to the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/index.html) on the
Terraform Vault provider for details on how you can provide a Vault token for this Terraform
operation. In general, you might want to do this with a Root token.

## Consul Provider

Refer to the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/consul/index.html)
on how to configure the ACL token for the provider if needed.

## Vault Token

Instead of generating a Vault Token by hand while configuring Nomad, we instead choose to configure
Vault to enable the [AWS authentication method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html) so
that Nomad servers instance will be able to retrieve a token on first boot purely by authenticating
with Vault via their Instance Profile.

## What this module does

This module first provisions two policies and
[token roles](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/token/index.html#create-update-token-role)
in Vault.

### Policies

- `nomad_server_policy`: This policy allows the token holder to create a periodic token with the `nomad_cluster_policy` using the `nomad_server` token role.
- `nomad_cluster_policy`: This policy allows Nomad to create child tokens for jobs that require it.

### Roles

- `nomad_server`: This allows the creation of a token that is passed to Nomad for Nomad to create child tokens for use with jobs using the `nomad_cluster` role.
- `nomad_cluster`: This role is used by Nomad servers to create child tokens for use with jobs.

### Tokens

Using a source token obtained from the `aws-auth` module that has the `nomad_server_policy`, we
can create a new `nomad_cluster` token using the `nomad_cluster` role.

The `nomad_cluster` token will then be passed to Nomad servers for Nomad to manage. This token will
be used by Nomad servers to create child tokens for use with jobs.

## Integration with `Core` module

After you have applied this module, a key will be set in Consul's KV store. The default
`user_data` scripts of the Core's Nomad servers and clients will check for the presence of this
key in Consul to configure themselves accordingly. Refer to the Core module's documentation on how
to update your Nomad cluster.
