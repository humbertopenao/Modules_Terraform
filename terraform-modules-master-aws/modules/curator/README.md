old indices in your Elasticsearch cluster.

## Requirements

- Core
- Elasticsearch cluster â€” You can optionally choose to use the [elasticsearch module](../elasticsearch) to run your cluster

## Default settings

By default, `curator` is configured to match tags from logs sent from the example configuration
provided in the [`td-agent`](../td-agent) module. It also matches logs tagged with `docker.*` for
your Nomad jobs.

If you have custom prefix or suffix to define, consider using the `actions` submodule in this
module.

## Docker Image

You should build a Docker image from the official [repository](https://github.com/elastic/curator)
and push it to your own Docker Registry. Then, configure the relevant entrypoints and arguments.
